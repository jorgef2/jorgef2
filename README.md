# Jorge Fernandez

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Jorge, a recent data science graduate with a passion for unraveling complex datasets to uncover insights and drive better decision-making. Below is a brief overview of my academic background and interests.

## About Me

I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Here I developed an interest in atmospheric sciences, which is a field rich in data science methodologies. Tackling problems from predicting weather patterns to understanding climate variations taught me the importance of accurate data modeling and fueled my passion for technology and analytics.

To dive deeper into the data science domain, I pursued a Master of Science in Data Science at DePaul University. This broadened my understanding of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, and also provided me with hands-on experience in predictive modeling and data engineering.

## Interests

I am always fascinated by the challenges of extracting actionable insights from raw data. My academic and professional journeys have equipped me with skills in:

- Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling
- Machine Learning and AI
- Data Visualization and Interpretive Analysis

I'm continuously exploring new tools and techniques to enhance my data science toolkit.
